**What is your full discord username and user id?**
- Your discord username including your discriminator (i.e. @Clyde#0001)
- Your discord ID (you can get this by enabling developer mode, right-clicking on yourself, and clicking "copy ID". this is NOT your 4 digit discriminator and will likely be 18-22 digits long.)
